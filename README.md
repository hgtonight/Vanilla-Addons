Ideas
=====
* Auto Refresh comments: Vanilla 2.1 removed a much loved feature known as auto refresh in the name of scalability. Pull the last page of the discussion on comment submission and use JS to figure out if anything has changed.
* A Mod Was Here: Allow moderators to 'sign off' on potentially questionable content in a way to alert other moderators.
* Feature Guide: Offer an excellent feature tour on page for new users.
* Community Streams: Create a user submitted stream page and show an 'Streaming Now' widget
* Yaga Author Meta: Show a user's Yaga meta data in the author info event. Configurable.
* Easy Module Sorting: Show a list of all available modules in a drag n drop interface to set the sort order and visibility options.
* Yaga Flag Negative Content: Once a UGC's score hits a threshold, hide the post and send to the moderation queue.
* Yaga Featured Badges: User's can pick badges they would like to feature on their profile and/or posts.
* Many more...
